## About The Project

This is a simple dinner randomizer I made to help my mum decide what to make for dinner.

Insipired by my mum asking me what to make for dinner so often I decided to put some of our meals into a website she can tap on to get a idea of what to for dinner.

Aiming for a an art deco theme and coloring. Somewhat inspired by my local Pakistani restaurant.

## Status

This project is completed and I am not working on it at the moment.

In the future I would like to include the recipe and ingredient list for each dinner item.
